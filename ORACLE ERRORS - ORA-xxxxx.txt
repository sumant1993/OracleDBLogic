1. Getting into hr schema through SQLPLUS
show con_name;


select name, con_id from v$pdbs;


select name from v$active_services where con_id = 3;


exit;


--make entry in tnsora file (C:\app\Shuddhendu\virtual\product\12.2.0\dbhome_1\network\admin)


ORCLPDB=
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = localhost)(PORT = 1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = orclpdb)
    )
  )
Login into sysdba again!


Show con_name;


alter session set container = orclpdb;


select name, open_mode from v$pdbs; 


alter pluggable database open;


ALTER USER hr IDENTIFIED BY hr ACCOUNT UNLOCK;


conn hr/hr@ORCLPDB;
show user;
	



2. TNS LISTENER NOT RUNNING
HOST = localhost
PORT = 1521...and still not running
Error → 
Status : Failure - Test failed : IO Error: The Network Adapter could not establish the connection vendor code 17002
Solution → 


1. Go to cmd (Run as Administrator)
2. Type “lsnrctl status” i.e. ListenerControl Status
3. If something like ‘Unknown Error’ comes up, it means listener is stopped and not running
4. To start the listener, type “lsnrctl start” i.e. ListenerControl Start
5. This will start the listener and problem should be fixed
	________________


3. Vendor Code 28002
Warning ⇒ The password will expire in 7 days
Solution ⇒ Just Click OK and set the new password
Command ⇒ ALTER USER username IDENTIFIED BY password 
Ex: ALTER USER HR IDENTIFIED BY HR;


If password is expired -
   1. Go to cmd  (Run as Administrator)
   2. Type - “sqlplus sys as sysdba”
   3. Type the password (HR/HR/anything)
   4. Then execute - “ALTER USER HR IDENTIFIED BY HR;” 
   5. Done
   6. For oracle 12c, we need to provide the service name along with the login credentials.


conn hr/hr@ORCLPDB;
	  



4. ORA-12560 TNS: protocol adapter error
Solution ⇒ 
1. Go to Run (Win + R)
2. Then type services.msc
3. Select OracleMTSRecoveryService and click start this service
4. Select OracleServicesORCL and start this service
5. Now, we should be able to connect
6. If not, go to cmd and connect as sysdba


                        4. ORA-01033 Database initialization or shutdown in progress


sqlplus


sys as sysdba
sysdba


alter session set container = orclpdb;


Startup open;
